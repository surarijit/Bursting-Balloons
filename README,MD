The name Bursting Balloons itself suggests that you need to burst some bubbles. Considering environmental factors i have choosen the green balloons that would require bursting. 

To run this game on your computer, you just need to have pygame installed on your computer. Packages of which could be found at https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
For those smart people who prefer command line for installation follow this thread https://askubuntu.com/questions/399824/how-to-install-pygame and you will be able to run this program just like any normal pygame programs.

I would like to hear any suggestions as well as happy to see any contributions you make to develop this game.
